This directory provides code to compute anomaly detection scores using a trained GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model, specifically designed for radar A-scope signals. We give our result for review test

【1】 Normalize the Anomaly_score
============================
Please execute the following command:
 run step1_caculate_anomaly_score_norm.m
 run step2_save_norm_result.m
============================
【2】 Normalize the Anomaly_score result
============================
This is our finally normalize Anomaly_score result.
