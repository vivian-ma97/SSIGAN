This directory provides code to compute anomaly detection scores using a trained GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model, specifically designed for radar A-scope signals.


============================
【1】Load the Pretrained GAN Model Weights
============================

1. Make sure you have placed the pretrained GAN model weights (typically `.pth` or `.pt` files) in the `trained_models/` directory.
2. The main script will automatically load the weights at runtime, or you can customize the path in `main_generate_score.py`.

============================
【3】Run the Main Script to Generate Anomaly Scores
============================

Please execute the following command:

    python test_our.py
